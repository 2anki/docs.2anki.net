## Why don't you just make a Anki add-on?
    
I am personally not interested in maintaining a Anki add-on. I am very confident that the web is the way to go, let me elaborate.
    
It's not an experience I desire for myself. Making websites is simple, rewarding, and normal people will appreciate it in many cases. The barrier for entry is lower. The tools are really good and they keep getting better.
    
It's no secret that add-on development for Anki is like the wild wild west. Stuff keeps breaking between versions and so on. Checkout this podcast episode for a better understanding of my views on this particular subject¬†[Deep Weeb Podcast # 4 - Alexander Alemayhu and the challenges of the Anki Ecosystem](https://youtu.be/qJ740mmi8kE).
    
When all of that is said, if enough people beg me to create a official Anki add-on. I will likely do it, but until I am convinced of the return of investment it will only be a nice to have.
