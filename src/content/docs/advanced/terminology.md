The purpose of 2anki.net is to make the flashcard creation process simpler and faster for people all around the world. The long-term goal is to help in mass adoption of Anki.

On the website users can upload their documents or create datasources.

## Documents

Documents can be invidivual HTML files or ZIP files with lots of HTML files with media files like images, audio, etc. 

## Data sources 

Data sources are third party integrations. A example is Notion. Where we use the Notion API to retrieve pages, databases and blocks. 

## Anki Flashcards

Documents and data sources both produce APKG files which contains the data necessary to create flashcards in Anki.
