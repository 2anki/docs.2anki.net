## Data Processing

Some file handling occurs on external servers to reduce browser overhead. For debugging purposes, your cards may be logged but are not preserved over time. If you accidentally upload sensitive information, contact us and we'll delete the server logs.

We log IP addresses for research purposes. No other personally identifiable information is collected or harvested.
