description: Information on how Zip files are handled on 2anki.net
---

To upload a valid ZIP file to 2anki.net, you need to ensure that the file contains either HTML, CSV, or Markdown files. 
Also the file should end with a suffix of `.zip`. 

For example you upload `example.zip` and it contains `example.html` or `example.csv` or `example.md`.
The ZIP file can contain multiple files, and the system will automatically detect the type of file and process it accordingly.
This is useful if you have multiple files that you want to convert to Anki flashcards.
